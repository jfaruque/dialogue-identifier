<h2 class="heading">Heart</h2>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Regulus rounds the corner at the same time as James and they run right into each other sending all their books scattering to the floor. </p><p>“Sorry, I didn’t mean to–” James starts as they both bend down to pick up their things.</p><p>“Watch it, Potter!” Regulus says, but then freezes when he gets a glimpse of what’s in his hands. James freezes also.</p><p>Regulus is holding James’ notebook and it’s open to a page filled with his name. Regulus’ name. In various forms.</p><p>
<em>“Regulus Arcturus Black” surrounded by little stars. </em>
</p><p>
<em>A <strong>heart</strong> with “R. A. B.” in the middle. </em>
</p><p>
<em>A drawing of the Leo Constellation, the Regulus star significantly bigger than the others. </em>
</p><p>But it’s what’s at the bottom of the page that catches Regulus’ eye the most.</p><p>
<em>“Regulus Potter”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Regulus Arcturus Potter”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“James Black”</em>
</p><p>But “James Black” is crossed out several times with the word “blah” written beside it. It makes Regulus chuckle a bit and he looks up at James with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>“I can explain.” James tries to tell him, and his face is bright red.</p><p>“So…” Regulus starts slowly. “You don’t like my last name? What’s wrong with ‘Black’?” Regulus asks.</p><p>“No. Nothing. I like your last name. I just–” James stumbles over his words.</p><p>“I mean, you’re right.” Regulus shrugs “It’s not a great last name. Plus… ‘Regulus Potter’ has a nice ring to it.” He smirks and James freezes again.</p><p>Regulus doesn’t wait for James to respond, he just turns on his heel and walks away. It’s a few moments before James seems to find his words again.</p><p>“Hey! My notebook!!” James calls after him.</p><p>But Regulus just keeps walking with a soft smile as he runs his fingers over the heart with his initials. Yeah, James is never getting that notebook back.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<h2 class="heading">Rain</h2>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>James flies across the pitch to hover beside Regulus.</p><p>“We should go down, Reg.” James shouts.</p><p>“What? Don’t like flying in the <strong>rain</strong>, Potter? Scared you’ll slip off your broom?” Regulus teases.</p><p>“No. Just don’t fancy getting struck by lightning, Regulus.” James says and Regulus rolls his eyes.</p><p>“We’re not going to get struck–”</p><p>
<em>CRACK</em>
</p><p>Lightning flashes across the sky and Regulus’ eyes go wide for a second and James lifts an eyebrow at him.</p><p>“Fine. We can go down.” Regulus huffs and flies towards the ground without waiting for James.</p><p>James lands a few seconds after Regulus and gets off his broom to stand right in front of him.</p><p>“You’re so stubborn.” James shakes his head.</p><p>“And you’re no fun.” Regulus says.</p><p>“Oh, really?” James smirks and grabs Regulus’ hand to pull him closer. Regulus goes willingly and they gaze into each other’s eyes for a moment then James’ eyes flick down to Regulus’ lips.</p><p>“You gonna kiss me in the rain, Potter? How very cliché of you.”</p><p>“You don’t want me to?” James starts to pull away. “That’s fine, I’ll–” Regulus pulls him back before James can finish his sentence.</p><p>“James, if you do not kiss me right now, I swear–” Regulus cuts himself off when he sees James grinning. “What?”</p><p>“You called me James.” James swoons.</p><p>Regulus rolls his eyes and starts to pull away but James pulls him back. They crash their lips together and kiss in the rain in the middle of the quidditch pitch.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Harry walks into the living room where James and Regulus are sitting on the couch.</p><p>“DAAAAD! PAAAA!” Harry screams.</p><p>“We’re right here, Haz.” James says, rubbing his ear.</p><p>“The volume, he gets from you.” Regulus whispers so only James can hear, and James rolls his eyes.</p><p>“What’s going on?” James asks and reaches his arms out for Harry to come closer. Harry walks over and stands in front of them. “What’s wrong, bud?”</p><p>“This!” Harry says firmly and grins so wide it can’t even be considered a grin anymore and aggressively points to his <strong>teeth</strong>. James and Regulus share a look.</p><p>“Your teeth?” Regulus asks confused.</p><p>“Yes! This one!” He opens his mouth and points to one <strong>tooth</strong>. “It’s all wiggly.”</p><p>“Oh! You have a loose tooth!” James says excitedly. </p><p>“Yes! And Ron said it’s going to fall out, but I think he’s nutters. That couldn’t happen.”</p><p>“Well, Haz, he’s right.” Regulus tells him cautiously.</p><p>“WHAT?!” Harry is screaming again.</p><p>“Harry, it’s okay. It’s normal for your teeth to fall out–” Regulus starts to explain.</p><p>“My teeth are going to fall out of my mouth! Parts of my head are going to fall off, and you think that’s normal?!” Harry interrupts.</p><p>“And the dramatics, he gets from you.” James whispers and Regulus and Harry look at him with identical glares. Regulus turns back to Harry and pulls him onto the couch.</p><p>“Yes, you’re going to lose your teeth, but it’s not a bad thing, it’s a good thing. Your baby teeth need to fall out to make room for your new teeth.” Regulus softly tries to explain again. </p><p>“I’m not a baby.” Harry pouts.</p><p>“Exactly.” James tells him. “Those little guys have to go away so you can get bigger, grown-up teeth. Like these.” James gives him a wide smile.</p><p>Harry narrows his eyes and skeptically looks back and forth between Regulus and James.</p><p>“It’s really okay?” Harry asks in a smaller voice.</p><p>“We promise.” Regulus assures him.</p><p>“Fine. I guess it’s okay then.” Harry sighs. “Can I go play upstairs?” He asks.</p><p>“Of course, bud.” James tells him. Regulus and James both give Harry a kiss and he gets up to leave the room.</p><p>“I wonder when I’m going to lose my baby fingers.” They hear Harry whisper, looking at his hands as he’s walking up the stairs.</p><p>“I don’t think we explained that very well.” James’ eyes go a bit wide.</p><p>“Wait, Harry, hold on a second!” Regulus call after him and they both get up to follow Harry.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<h2 class="heading">Cigarette</h2>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Regulus is smoking on the balcony when James comes to stand beside him at the railing. Regulus slides his pack of cigarettes over to James who takes one and lights it before sliding the pack back to Regulus.</p><p>“Thank you.” James says.</p><p>Regulus hums in response. James takes a long inhale but instead of exhaling like a normal person, James tilts his head back and blows out small breaths making the smoke come out in several little puffs.</p><p>“You’re an idiot.” Regulus scoffs.</p><p>“Thank you.” James says again.</p><p>“That wasn’t a compliment.” Regulus tells him.</p><p>“Anything from you is a compliment. And I’ll always thank you for it.” James leans in to bump Regulus’ shoulder.</p><p>“You’re ridiculous.” Regulus pushes him away.</p><p>“Thank you.” James grins at him.</p><p>Regulus turns to scowl at James and James’ grin only gets bigger. They enter a weird sort of staring contest that Regulus knows he won’t be able to maintain before he does something stupid like push James off the balcony or kiss him senseless. He’s not sure which he’d prefer at the moment so instead he just rolls his eyes and turns back to the railing.</p><p>“You’re insufferable.” He mumbles.</p><p>“Thank you.” James smirks.</p><p>Regulus looks back at James and narrows his eyes curiously. He tilts his head to the side and thinks for a moment.</p><p>“You have beautiful eyes.” Regulus tells him.</p><p>“Tha… wait what?!” James sputters then just stares at Regulus dumbfounded.</p><p>Regulus smirks victoriously, puts out his <strong>cigarette</strong> and turns to go inside.</p><p>“Bye James.” He says cheekily over his shoulder as James stands frozen at the railing.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p>“So, you know my friend James?” Sirius says trying to sound nonchalant.  </p><p>“Ugh.” Regulus just groans as he wipes down the counter not looking at Sirius.</p><p>“Why do you always do that when I bring up James?” Sirius asks while starting to brew fresh coffee.  </p><p>“James annoys me.” Regulus tells him simply.</p><p>“You’ve never even met him.”</p><p>“Doesn’t mean he can’t annoy me.”</p><p>“Well, he needs a job.” Sirius moves on to restock the fridge with the various types of milk.</p><p>“Good for him.” Regulus says sarcastically as he’s refilling the pastries.</p><p>“I got him a job here.”</p><p>“You <em>what</em>?” Regulus whips around to face Sirius.</p><p>“Yeah, he’s going to be here any minute, but I have to take inventory and–” Sirius starts.</p><p>“What does that mean?” Regulus cuts him off while glaring at him.</p><p>“Means you have to train him.” Sirius says.</p><p>“Nope. He’s your friend, you train him.” Regulus tells him as he hears the bell at the door. He turns around and makes eye contact with the most beautiful man he has ever seen, and he freezes.</p><p>“Hey Prongs!”</p><p>“Hey Pads!” They greet each other and Regulus has heard Sirius talk about James enough to know that “Prongs” is, in fact, James Potter.</p><p>“James, this is Regulus. Reggie, this is James.” Sirius introduces them.</p><p>“Hi Regulus!” James says brightly reaching out his hand, but Regulus remains frozen just staring at him. Eventually, James lowers his hand but doesn’t break eye contact with Regulus.  </p><p>“Right, I was going to have you <strong>shadow</strong> Reggie this morning, but he doesn’t–”  </p><p>“Go away Sirius.” Regulus interrupts him without taking his eyes off James.  </p><p>“Yeah, I thought you might say that. I’ll be in the back.” Sirius sing-songs as he’s walking away.</p><p>James continues to smile at Regulus, and he finally unfreezes and feels himself smiling back. Suddenly Regulus is not so annoyed.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<h2 class="heading">King</h2>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>James and Sirius walk in the front door carrying bags of groceries.</p><p>“He’s got you so whipped. You treat him like fucking royalty. I promise he’ll survive even if he doesn’t have his <em>specific brand of tea.</em>” Sirius says the last words in a mocking tone.</p><p>“First of all, I never said he wouldn’t survive if he didn’t have the tea. <em>He</em> would have been fine. Right now, <em>you’re</em> the one acting like you won’t survive because it took 10 extra minutes to stop at the other shop.” James tells him.</p><p>Sirius puts his bags down, crosses his arms and opens his mouth presumably to defend himself, but James cuts him off.</p><p>“Second, I wanted to get him the tea. I like doing these things for him. He doesn’t ask me for them or demand I do them. I just know the random little things that make him smile. And if taking 10 extra minutes to stop at a second shop means I get to see his soft, adorable, morning smile when he opens the cabinet tomorrow and sees his favorite tea, that’s completely worth it for me. If that means I’m whipped, so be it.” James shrugs.</p><p>They’ve finished putting the groceries away and are now leaning against the kitchen counter.</p><p>“And third, of course I treat him like royalty. I love him and I would do anything to make him happy. It makes <em>me</em> happy to see him happy. And if I get to be the one to make him happy? God, it’s one of the best feelings in the world. So yeah, he deserves to be treated like a <strong>king</strong>, and I’m happy to treat him like one.” James says simply.</p><p>Sirius is quiet for a moment just staring at James.</p><p>“You are such a sap.” Sirius finally tells him.</p><p>“You are so getting laid tonight.” Regulus tells him as he wraps his arms around James’ waist.</p><p>James didn’t even hear Regulus come in the kitchen, but he smiles brightly and turns to face him. Regulus pushes up on his toes to kiss him and James wraps him in his arms pulling him closer to deepen the kiss. Both of them quickly forget that Sirius is still in the kitchen.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p>“What are you doing here?” Regulus ask Sirius exasperatedly when he opens the door.</p><p>“I’m here to help you get ready for your date with James, duh.” Sirius says pushing past him with an arm full of clothes.</p><p>“Sirius, I don’t need your help, and I certainly don’t need your clothes. I already know what I’m wearing and he’s going to be here in an hour. So can you please leave?” Regulus is still holding the door open, but Sirius has already made his way to the bedroom. Regulus closes the door with a sigh and reluctantly follows Sirius.</p><p>“Is this what you’re planning on wearing?” Sirius asks pointing to the neat black slacks and dark green jumper Regulus has laying on his bed. Regulus just nods his head. “Well, thank God I’m here! You have no <strong>fashion</strong> sense at all!” Sirius unceremoniously drops all his clothes on the bed beside Regulus’ outfit and starts going through them.</p><p>Sirius has Regulus try on no less than 20 outfits, all different combinations of the things he brought over. About an hour later Regulus is standing in front of his mirror wearing neat black slacks and a dark green jumper with a beaming Sirius beside him.</p><p>“See! This is perfect! I don’t even remember bringing this, but obviously I’m a genius because this looks great!” Sirius says excitedly.</p><p>“Yes, thank you, you’re a genius.” Regulus tells him, dripping with sarcasm as he rolls his eyes. “Now can you please leave he’s going to be here any–” The doorbell cuts him off and Sirius runs out of the room. Regulus just groans and follows him.</p><p>“…and no funny business and have him home by eleven.” Regulus walks in on Sirius telling James. James’ eyes immediately shift to Regulus, and he brushes past Sirius.</p><p>“Sure, whatever you say Sirius.” James says dismissively walking up to Regulus. “You look beautiful.” He says with a bright smile passing Regulus a bouquet of flowers. Regulus takes the flowers and hides his smile behind them whispering a small “Thank you.”</p><p>“You ready to go?” James asks.</p><p>“Yes, please.” He takes James’ hand, and they walk towards the door. As he passes Sirius, he hands him the flowers.</p><p>“Put these in water then get out of my house.” He tells Sirius firmly then instantly soften when he turns back to James, and they leave for their date.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<h2 class="heading">Salt</h2>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>James walks in the door and hears soft sniffles coming from the living room. He rushes in to find Regulus sitting on the couch, knees pulled up to his chest and a blanket wrapped around his shoulders. James immediately rushes to his side and takes Regulus in his arms. Regulus melts into him instantly, crying on his shoulder.</p><p>“Love, what’s wrong?” James asks, worry clear in his voice.</p><p>Regulus doesn’t answer, just starts crying harder.</p><p>“Regulus, you’re scaring me, you have to tell me what happened.”</p><p>“He… he… he died.” Regulus sobs and all the blood rushes from James’ face as worst case scenarios run through his head.</p><p>“Who died?” James asks cautiously and terrified.</p><p>Again, Regulus doesn’t answer, he just picks up a book from beside him and drops it in James’ lap.</p><p>“Regulus?” James is still panicked but also confused.</p><p>“My… my fa… my favorite character… he… he died!” Regulus says through hiccupping sobs.</p><p>“Regulus…” James says softly while breathing a sigh of relief.</p><p>“James, he died! He just… he just… out of nowhere… he just died.” Regulus leans into James even further and James wraps him in his arms.</p><p>“Regulus, I love you, but you just scared the shit out of me, love.” James tells him. “You do know these characters aren’t real, right?” James doesn’t mean to be insensitive, he knows Regulus loves these characters. But James genuinely thought someone they know just died.</p><p>Regulus pulls away from James with a look of utter betrayal on his face.</p><p>“Way to rub <strong>salt</strong> in the wound, James!” He lets out another sob.</p><p>James pulls him back into his arms.</p><p>“I’m sorry, love.” James rubs Regulus’ back in a soothing motion. “Do you want to tell me about the character?” James asks softly.</p><p>James listens to Regulus tell him all about his favorite character as he tries to regulate his breathing and get his heart rate back to a normal pace.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<h2 class="heading">Hiss</h2>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Regulus is reading by the lake with his back resting against a large tree. Suddenly he hears a light hissing in his ear and swats at the side of his head, only for his hand to smack James right in the face.</p><p>“Did you just <strong>hiss</strong> in my ear?” Regulus asks incredulously, ignoring the way James is rubbing the red mark on his cheek.</p><p>“Yes! Last night you said you love my hisses!” James defends himself.</p><p>“I said I love your <em>kisses</em>, you idiot.” Regulus rolls his eyes.</p><p>“Oh, thank God. I was so bloody confused!” James says with a relieved sigh.</p><p>“Why would I say I love your hisses? What does that even mean?” Regulus questions as James settles against the tree beside him.</p><p>“I don’t know!” James throws his hands up. “Why do you think I was so confused and hissed in your ear?!”</p><p>“You’re ridiculous, you know that?” Regulus says with a fond chuckle.</p><p>“Yes, you may have told me once or twice.” James smiles back and they gaze at each other for a moment.</p><p>“So…?” Regulus says after a beat of silence.</p><p>“So, what?” James asks and Regulus just raises his eyebrow with a tiny smirk.</p><p>“Oh. Right. Kisses.” James finally catches on and leans in to kiss Regulus.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>“Hey Prongs? Have you seen–”</p><p>Regulus instinctually throws the covers over his head when Sirius bursts into James’ room.</p><p>“Nope. Haven’t seen Reg anywhere. Sorry.” James answers without letting Sirius finish his question.</p><p>Sirius doesn’t say anything, and Regulus can practically feel him glaring at James even though he can’t see him.</p><p>“I was <em>going</em> to ask if you’ve seen my ABBA <strong>vinyl</strong>.” Sirius says slowly and Regulus can hear the threat in his voice. There’s a beat of silence, only filled by the sounds of ABBA playing low from the other side of the room.   </p><p>“Oh… umm… I… well…” James stumbles over his words and Regulus rolls his eyes.</p><p>“James…? Have you been fucking my brother while listening to ABBA?” Now Sirius’ voice is a mix of disgust and disappointment.</p><p>“No! Like I said, I haven’t even seen Regulus!” James lies completely unconvincingly.</p><p>“Hey, Reg.” Sirius says accusingly.</p><p>“Hey, Sirius.” Regulus responds with a resigned sigh.</p><p>“Really, James? ABBA? Not really the best bedroom music.”  </p><p>“You’d be surprised.” Regulus says, still under the covers.</p><p>“Ugh, gross.” Sirius fake gags.</p><p>“The vinyl’s on the turntable. Get it and get out.” James tells him.</p><p>“Suddenly, I’m not in the mood to listen to ABBA anymore. Or ever again.” Sirius makes a series of gagging and disgusted noises before Regulus hears the door slam.</p><p>Regulus comes out from under the covers and glares at James.</p><p>“What?” James shrugs.</p><p>“You are the absolute worst liar.” Regulus tells him.</p><p>“You’re the one who tried to <em>hide under the covers</em>! Like he wouldn’t notice that!” James huffs.</p><p>“Whatever. Just go flip the album.”</p><p>James smirks and gets up to flip the vinyl.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>James sees Regulus sitting in the library at a table filled with books and several pieces of parchment.

<p>It’s the end of the school day and Regulus has just made it to his locker. He enters his combination and as soon as he opens it, a folded piece of paper falls to the floor. He bends down to pick it up and when he unfolds it, his jaw drops at what he sees.</p><p>~</p><p>
<em>Roses are red, your eyes are blue,</em>
</p><p>
<em>You make me see things as if they’re brand new.</em>
</p><p>
<em>I can’t think straight when you’re around,</em>
</p><p>

</p><p>

He schools his features before he looks around, and just as he thought, James is lurking at the other end of the hall.</p><p>Regulus raises an eyebrow at James and James purses his lips and shrugs back at him. Regulus rolls his eyes fondly and looks back down at the poem.</p><p>It is simultaneously the best and worst poem he has ever read and he smiles to himself as he tucks it between the pages of one of his books. He rips off a piece of notebook paper, scribbles something down and folds it in half. He gathers his things and makes his way to the end of the hall. He barely slows down as he drops the piece of paper in James’ hand and keeps walking without saying a word.</p><p>——————</p><p>James’ hands are shaking as he opens the piece of paper Regulus gave him.</p><p>~</p><p>

Regulus knows he’s wrong and James knows he should apologize, but they’re both too stubborn and now it’s just a point of pride.</p><p>So now it’s raining, and James is sitting on the couch alone trying to find a random movie to watch.

I can’t… I can’t just… I won’t…” James hiccups trying to get his words out.</p><p>Regulus stays quiet but James can see his bottom lip quivering.  </p><p>“Reg…” James says and it’s barely a breath.</p><p>Regulus stays quiet for another moment then takes a shuddering breath.</p><p>“I’ll never be <strong>enough</strong> for you, James.” Regulus has his head down and he speaks so softly James almost doesn’t hear him. “I’ll never be good enough or be able to love you enough. I’ll never be able to love you like I should. Like you deser–”</p><p>James is across the room before Regulus can finish his thought. He has his hands on Regulus’ cheeks and is kissing him so fiercely Regulus stumbles back a bit. One of James’ arms moves to wrap around Regulus’ back to steady him and hold him close. The kiss is filled with passion and tears and love, and they don’t stop kissing until neither one of them can breathe.</p><p>When they finally break apart, James rests his forehead against Regulus’ and looks deep into his eyes.</p><p>“You are so much more than enough.” James tells him slowly and firmly, leaving no room for argument. “You are <em>everything</em>. You are my everything. I have never been loved the way you love me. Your love is <em>everything</em> to me.” James whispers.</p><p>“James…” Regulus has tears streaming down his cheeks. A moment ago, Regulus was trying to push him away, now he’s clinging to James like he’ll disappear if Regulus doesn’t hold him tight enough. But James isn’t going anywhere.</p><p>“I love you, Regulus. More than you could possibly know.” Regulus is staring into James’ eyes like he’s searching for a lie. But he won’t find one.</p><p>Regulus stays quiet for a moment then takes a shuddering breath.</p><p>“I love you, Jamie. So much.” Regulus whispers and drops his head on James' shoulder and melts into his arms.  </p><p>James holds him as close as possible and tells him over and over how much he loves him and how much he means to him. And he’ll keep telling him over and over until Regulus knows that he’s enough. That he’s everything.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p>Regulus is standing with James in their garage looking at what is probably the saddest excuse for a car Regulus has ever seen.</p><p>“It’s old.” Regulus says.</p><p>“It’s <strong><em>vintage</em></strong>.” James counters.</p><p>“It’s ugly.” Regulus is walking around the car.</p><p>“It’s… okay, yes, it is ugly. But it won’t be when I’m done with it.” Regulus walks towards James with a skeptical look.</p><p>“I promise, it’ll be beautiful. You’ll see.” James tells him. “Please, can I keep it?” James pouts.</p><p>Regulus smiles fondly at James and wraps his arms around his waist.</p><p>“Jamie, you don’t need my permission to keep it. But I don’t understand why you don’t just want to buy a new car. You know, one that actually runs?” Regulus asks him.</p><p>“Restoring it, rebuilding it, is the whole point. It’s not just about the car, it’s about the process.” James has a glimmer in his eyes that makes him look absolutely beautiful.</p><p>“The process?” Regulus says, amused and endeared by how excited James is.</p><p>“Yes! It’ll be fun. Doesn’t it sound fun?” James runs his hand over the hood of the car and his finger tips turn black from the dust and dirt.</p><p>“It sounds dirty.” Regulus tells him.</p><p>“You don’t want to help?” James teasingly wiggles his fingers towards Regulus.</p><p>“I’ll watch.” Regulus grabs James’ wrist to avoid the dirt but uses his hold on him to pull James in for a kiss.</p><p>And Regulus quickly realizes that watching a sweaty, greasy, dirty James is, indeed, a lot of fun.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p>James is leaning against the door frame taking in the scene in front of him.</p><p>Regulus is sitting on the living room floor with his back against the couch. There’s a film playing on the TV, music coming from a separate speaker in the corner and a laptop open on the coffee table playing a YouTube video. Regulus’ <strong>journal</strong> is open on the floor beside him, there’s a book open but forgotten in his lap and Regulus is leaning against the couch scrolling on his phone.</p><p>“What are you doing, love?” James asks fondly after a minute.</p><p>“Just watching YouTube.” Regulus says simply without looking up.</p><p>James smiles and walks over to sit behind Regulus on the couch. Regulus tilts his head back and James leans down to kiss him.</p><p>“What’s with everything else?” James asks.</p><p>“What do you mean?” Regulus asks looking genuinely confused and James just sort of nods towards the various things around the room.</p><p>“Oh… well, I’m watching the YouTube video, but the TV is background noise and the music helps me focus. But sometimes my mind still gets distracted so I like to read for a bit while I’m watching and that helps me pay attention to the video. And then either the video or the book or the music will make me think of something so I have my journal to write it down so I don’t forget. And right now, I’m looking for what I want to watch next and also scrolling TikTok.” Regulus explains like it’s completely obvious.</p><p>“I love the way your mind works.” James smiles at him again and leans down for another kiss.</p><p>James settles back on the couch and starts watching the film and Regulus goes back to watching YouTube. (And reading. And listening to music. And journaling. And scrolling. And chatting with James about the film.)</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p>Regulus pushes his way to the bar and slides in beside James who looks feral. Regulus smirks as he orders his drink then turns to face James; James doesn’t turn to look at Regulus.</p><p>“What’s wrong, James?” Regulus ask innocently.</p><p>“You know what’s wrong.” James grits out through clenched teeth.</p><p>“Do I?” Regulus says as he runs his fingers down James’ arm. James doesn’t answer but Regulus sees his jaw tighten and something different flashes in his eyes. Regulus put his fingers on James’ chin and turns his head so they’re looking at each other.</p><p>“It was just a <strong>dance</strong>, James.” Regulus tells him dropping the faux innocent act.</p><p>“It was more than that to him and you know it.” James nods towards the guy Regulus was dancing with.</p><p>“Why does it matter?” Regulus asks.</p><p>“You know why it matters.” James’ voice is still firm, but with determination instead of anger.</p><p>“Do I?” Regulus says again.</p><p>“You should.” James tells him turning to face Regulus fully.</p><p>“Enlighten me.” Regulus says and he barely has the words out before James’ hands are on his hips pulling him closer.</p><p>“Because you’re mine.” James states simply as if it’s already a fact.</p><p>“Oh really?” Regulus asks trying to sound indifferent, but he can hear the hopefulness in his voice.</p><p>“Do you want to be?” James softens and genuinely asks.</p><p>“Are you mine?” Regulus asks as he wraps his arms around James’ neck.</p><p>“I’ve always been yours.” James whispers in his ear sending a shiver down Regulus spine.</p><p>“Then yeah, I want to be yours.” Regulus tells him and leans back slightly to look James in the eye.</p><p>James gazes into Regulus’ eyes pulling him impossibly closer to kiss him and somehow this kiss is different than all their others.  </p><p> </p><p>   </p>

<p>Regulus is waiting at the table for James to come back with their food. He tried to go up to the buffet with him, but James insisted on going alone for some reason. That was fine with Regulus, the less people he has to interact with at these things the better. These work events are some of the most boring things they have to attend. Regulus would feel bad saying that, except he knows James thinks they’re boring also.</p><p>James makes it back to the table and sits everything down then takes his seat beside Regulus.</p><p>“Thank you.” Regulus tells him but pauses when he looks down at the table. “What is this?” He holds up his fork in question.</p><p>“A fork.” James answers simply.</p><p>“Why is it plastic, James?”</p><p>“Because when you had a <strong>metal</strong> one, you stabbed a guy in the thigh with it.” James reminds him.</p><p>“Well, these things are <em>boring</em> and the guy was badmouthing you. <em>That</em> was entertaining and I got to defend your honor. Two birds, one fork.” He says casually. “Plus, it barely broke skin. I could do significantly more damage with a…” he looks down at the table. “Where is my knife, James?” He looks back up at James.</p><p>“I’ll cut your meat for you, love.” James says and kisses Regulus sweetly.</p><p>Regulus huffs and slumps back in his chair. He picks up his spoon- his only metal utensil- and stares at it while he twirls it between his fingers.</p><p>“What are you doing?” James asks skeptically.</p><p>“Determining if I could gouge someone’s eye out with this.</p><p>“We’re not coming next year.” James tells him as he plucks the spoon out of Regulus’ hand.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p>Regulus is sitting on the bathroom counter with James standing between his legs. He twists to set his eye shadow palette down and pick up something else. James is already opening his mouth to protest.</p><p>“No <strong>glitter</strong>.” He says, trying to take a step back but he doesn’t get very far.</p><p>“Yes glitter.” Regulus wraps his legs around James pulling him back in– which is unfair for multiple reasons.</p><p>“Reg.”</p><p>“James.”</p><p>“No. Glitter.” James tries again and Regulus puts his hands on his hips.</p><p>“What’s wrong with glitter, huh? Is it too–”</p><p>“It’s too messy.” James cuts him off. “It’s a bitch to clean, makeup wipes never get all of it off, and whatever shirt I wear, I’ll be finding glitter on it for weeks.” James is firm in his decision and he will not budge.</p><p>Regulus pouts and James crumbles.</p><p>“You know, that’s not going to work on me forever.” James grumbles as he leans in to let Regulus put glitter on his eyes and cheeks.</p><p>“Sure. You keep telling yourself that.” Regulus smirks.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
